## What was the most helpful aspect of this codeâ€™s structure?
- It's organized well, it has separated funcions so that could be easily tested and revised. Also it looks compact and easy to understand the process.

## What part was confusing or took longer to understand?
- I'm getting to be comfortable with the use of function, but still bit confusing with variable.
